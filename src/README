This application is used to programmatically update our events/workshop page on TerminalFour.

Since we don't have access privileges that let us run separate JS modules on our site, we have to nest everything between < script > HTML tags. It's the worst.


Program flow / Order we should copy and paste the modules into T4:
(1.) JSONGlobal.js --> this module contains the JSON string. It should be an array of JSON objects following the API format defined below.
(2.) globals.js --> declares global variables (obviously)
(3.) LSEvent.js --> defines the LSEvent class
(4.) LSEventSublist.js --> defines the LSEventSublist class. (We use it for series of events divided into multiple workshops, such as MTH Milestone workshops or Game Dev. workshops)
(5.) LSEventSectionList --> defines the class we use for each "type" of event we're hosting, such as APA Workshops, Study Jams, Welcome Week, etc.
(6.) init.js --> initializes key variables and parses JSON string

API Example for JSON Global:
{    
    "OfficialWorkshopTitle": "Adjusting to Academic Vocabulary",    
    "Department": "ELL",    
    "LeadPresenter": "Tracy/Kevin",    
    "SupportPerson": "Ayesha",    
    "Date": "10/1/2024",    
    "StartTime": "6:00",    
    "EndTime": "7:00",    
    "Location": "",    
    "Description": "Transform your ordinary to EXTRAordinary: Improve your academic vocabulary and learn how to select words that will dazzle your instructors.",    "SublistKey": ""  
}

Usage Notes:
Since we can't use external files/libraries, and since I don't want to create a CSV parser, we have to manually input the JSON string. We will have to hand-sanitize the CSV files for now, then convert them into a single-line JSON string. Someday, we'll want to fix this.
